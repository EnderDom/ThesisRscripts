### Scripts To Generate Thesis Figures

A relatively trivial set of scripts, but I thought I start collecting all the stuff 
I did during my PhD as some evidence that I was programming before I started in the 
software industry.

Most of these scripts will simply take a data set and output some sort of graph. The data is part
of my thesis which was published, so can be made publicly available.

### Requirements\Languages

R (R-base package)
perl

Some perl script may require extra libs, eg Image::Grab lib, they can be found on cpan

# Run

From within the folder of the .R run:
	Rscript scriptname.R

	
or for perl scripts:
	perl scriptname.pl
